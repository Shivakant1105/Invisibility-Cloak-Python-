Invisibility cloak through OpenCV Python3

1. Capture and store the background frame [ This will be done for some seconds ]
2. Detect the red colored cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithm.
3. Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask. [ used in code ]
4. Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect. [ video.mp4 ]


You need the following libraries
import cv2
import time
import numpy as np


Recording and caching the background for each frame.
##reading from the webcam
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
## Allow the system to sleep for 3 seconds before the webcam starts
time.sleep(3)
count = 0
background = 0
## Capture the background in range of 60
for i in range(60):
    ret, background = cap.read()
background = np.flip(background, axis=1)
